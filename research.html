        <h1>How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
        <!--begin sidebar-->
        <p><strong>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Excel</strong></li>
            <li><strong>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial
                    download</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You should already be familiar with:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <!--Some elements should be navy blue-->
            <li><strong>The basic functions and tools of Excel</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Research design and how to identify independent
                    variables and dependent variables</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate
            students undertaking original research
            projects.
            After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient
                analysis</li>
            <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
            <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software
                package PASW</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
        <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel
            installed. Open the document ToolBox_DataLesson.xls
            [[[NOTE: NEED LINK TO DOWNLOAD TUTORIAL EXCEL FILE]]] in Excel and
            follow along with the lesson, taking action
            as
            instructed.
            In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been
            entered in the first row of each column.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
            <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <strong>unique identifier.</strong></li>
            <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special
                characters), so change 4tutorial_types to
                tutorial_types.</li>
            <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore,
                change use and useful to perc_ease_of_use and
                perc_usefulness, respectively.</li>
            <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be
                readily apparent that Column F refers to
                Perceived
                Usefulness and Column G refers to Perceived Ease of Use.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
            <img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig3.png">
            <figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical
                values have been formatted as dichotomous
                variables.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the
            experiment.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In gender, change
                the "female" value to "F".</li>
            <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding
                new columns. For example, tasks_completed
                values (Y/Y/N)
                can be broken up into three components. So, add columns task1,
                task2, and task3, and reformat values
                appropriately.</li>
            <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then
                delete the old tasks_completed column.</li>
            <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
            <img src="datalesson_fig2.png">
            <figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent
                format.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <!--dichotomous needs to be navy-->
        <p>Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to
            indicate whether or not the value is represented
            for
            the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values <strong>dichotomous</strong>,
            which gives the
            researcher maximum flexibility in
            testing for relationships or correlations.</p>

        <!--begin sidebar-->
        <p><strong>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of
                characteristics for analysis. For example,
                separating experience
                levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects
                with low experience have perceived ease of use
                scores
                significantly different from those with medium and high
                experience levels.</strong></p>
        <!--end sidebar-->

        <ol>
            <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this
                sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
            <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <strong>Insert
                    > Columns</strong> for each distinct value
                in categorical data columns
                (tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, and task3).
                You do not have to add a new column for task1,
                task2, and
                task3 because their values are already dichotomous.</li>
            <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value.
                Copy and paste the values from the original
                column.</li>
            <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes)
                using the replace function: <strong>Edit >
                    Replace</strong>.</li>
            <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Run descriptive statistics</h2>
        <!--begin sidebar-->
        <p><strong>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new
                questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much
                higher on average
                than perc_usefulness, which also has a large variance. This
                suggests that a segment of users may not have
                considered the
                system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</strong></p>
        <!--end sidebar-->
        <!--continuous needs to be navu-->
        <p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output
            results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary,
            rearrange
            columns so that data requiring summary, those with <strong>continuous</strong>
            values, are adjacent. (In the
            spreadsheet, the continuous
            values of perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and perc_ease_of_use are
            already adjacent.)</p>
        <p>Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring
            summary, making sure not to include variable
            labels.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins...</strong> and make sure <strong>Analysis
                    ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click
                OK.</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive
                    Statistics</strong>. Click OK.
            </li>
            <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary
                    Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename
            this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label
            the
            output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should be
            perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats
            spreadsheet should
            now look like Figure 4.
            Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising
            a dataset before running inferential
            statistics.
            What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary
            statistics for perc_usefulness and
            perc_ease_of_use?</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig4.png">
            <figcaption>Excel will not run descriptive statistics with
                non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must
                be re-entered.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <!--page break-->

        <h2>Run inferential statistics</h2>
        <p>Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building,
            room 112, have PASW. You can also download a
            30-day
            free trial.)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select
                <strong>Open an existing data source > More
                    Files...</strong></li>
            <li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
            <li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK.
                You should now see the dataset.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under
            the <strong>Analyze</strong> menu in the
            standard toolbar.</p>
        <p>Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and
            tests. Under PASW's <strong>Analyze</strong>
            menu, see if you can also
            find the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
            <li>Simple linear regression</li>
            <li>Non-parametric correlation</li>

            <figcaption>Don't assume PASW doesn't run a given test. Many are

        <p>You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis
            of variance is the appropriate test. Go to
            <strong>Analyze >
                Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</strong> A new
            window will open prompting you to select the
            variables (by column
            name) to be tested.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the perc_usefulness variable from the scrollable list on
                the left, and click the top arrow to move it
                to the Test
                Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).</li>
            <li>Select the free_play variable from the scrollable list, and
                click the bottom arrow to move it to the
                Grouping Variable
                section (i.e. independent variable).</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Define Range...</strong>, and enter "0" in the
                Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field.
                This specifies the two
                categorical variables to be tested. Your screen should now look
                like Figure 6. Click Continue.</li>

            Figure
            7. Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical
            components (some of which must be cited in formal
            reports), it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of
            the PASW software. To save the results, go to
            <strong>File >
                Export</strong>. Change Document Type to the desired output
            format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
